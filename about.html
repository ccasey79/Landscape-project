            <p id="family-operated">A&H Landscapes is a family run business which started out in 2002. Nathan and Paul Streetly
            created the company as a father / son business, but as the company has progressed it now employs over 12 employee's.
            Pretty much every type of landscaping job you can think of has been worked on over the companies duration. We're really
            proud with how far the company has come since we started. The company is based in Northampton but we cover all the Midlands
            area. If it's a large landscaping project we are open to it nationally, feel free to enquire! We've been fortuate to have some really
            talented staff over the years, a special thanks to their hard work and dedication on behalf of the company.</p>

                in us in the jobs we've done. It has been a pleasure to work on the projects we've done and go beyond
                people's expectations! It's always very gratifying for us to transform a garden that we are really proud of and
                pleases our customers. We would also like to mention a special thanks to some of our suppliers, without them
                we wouldn't have some of the materials, tools and machines that help us greatly to achieve the best
                project results!</p>
